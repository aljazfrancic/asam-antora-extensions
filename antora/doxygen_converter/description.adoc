= Doxygen converter
Doxygen already outputs content in HTML form.
However, to use this in an Antora environment, the body must be extracted and included correctly.
Also, separating or augmenting the sections used in the output allows Asciidoctor to create the TOC automatically.

This extension provides the features to Antora to

. Build the Doxygen content from a given source in a given version
// TODO: Remove building from Antora pipeline and get generated content either from the source or a different repo / location. This will massively save time and remove the need to add doxygen-specific features to the Antora Docker image.
. Update the generated content to work with Antora
. Add the created (relevant) content to the Antora content
. Run this for all relevant components and versions, using attributes set in the respective component descriptor.
