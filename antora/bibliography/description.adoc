= ASAM Bibliography
As of now, Antora does not support bibliographies out of the box.
The Asciidoctor features and extensions do not work for JavaScript and distributed content.
Rather, they are typically written in Ruby and expect all content to be in one output file (which is not the case with Antora).

To solve this, ASAM has implemented a custom extension for Antora to support bibtex files and bibtex-style references.

== Configuration
To enable the bibliography feature in general, add the following configuration to the extension attributes:

[source, YAML]
----
bibliography: true
----

.Configuration example
====
[source,YAML]
----
antora:
  extensions:
  - require: './asam-antora-extensions/asam-antora_extension.js'
    bibliography: true
----
====

To enable the bibliography within a component, add the following configuration to respective antora.yml file:

[source, YAML]
----
asamBibliography: "module:path/to/file.bib"
----

.Configuration for a component where the bibliography file with the name "asambib.bib" is located in the module "standard" and the folder "bibliography"
====
[source,YAML]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    asamBibliography: 'standard:bibliography/asambib.bib'
----
====

To choose a different citation style or language, you can set the following parameters in either the site.yml (for the whole extension) or each relevant antora.yml (as asciidoc attribute for this component-version):

[source, YAML]
----
bibtex-style: <name of the csl file without extension (.csl)>
bibtex-locale: <valid language tag>
----

== Notes
All entries get an anchor with the following syntax: `bib-<entry-id>`, where `<entry-id>` is the id of the bibliography entry. +
The default style is `iso690-numeric-brackets-cs`, the default locale is `en`.

Those defaults are set in the `asam-antora_extensions.js`.
The default values of the bibliography extension itself may differ!

== How it works
The extension first finds the listed bibliography file (.bib) and parses its content.
Once Antora has classified all files, it first identifies the (first) page for each component-version combination where the `bibliography::[]` macro is called. +
It then sorts the pages and replaces each cite:[] macro with a link to the relevant bibliography page and the entry there, using the entry-id as input for the anchor, if the id was found in the bibliography file.

After all citations have been replaced, the extension creates the bibliography page, replacing the `bibliography::[]` call in its body with a formatted string containing all cited sources in the order defined by the chosen style.
If the chosen style does not provide a bibliography function, the bibliography page is removed completely from the Antora output (including its entry in the navigation).
